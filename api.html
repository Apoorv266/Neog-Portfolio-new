        <p>The world is a web of interconnected networks. Each and every computer is connected to each other on this
            planet. From desktops to devices, we can purchase, post, and pin anything and anywhere. We are connected to
            each other like never before. </p>

        <h2>How does data get from one point to another?</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered how different devices are connected to each other to allow us to place an order, make
            a reservation or book a flight? Here comes the role of API which stands for Application Programming
            Interface.</p>
        <p>
            API is the engine under the hood that is responsible for connecting different networks around the globe.API
            is also responsible for all the interactivity on the web.</p>

        <h2>Exactly what is an API?</h2>
        <p class="code">API stands for <b>Application Programming Interface.</b></p>

        <p>In simple language, API is a messenger that takes the request and tells the system what you want to do and in
            return, it gives a response.</p>

        <p>API can be visualized as a waiter in a restaurant. As the waiter is the critical link to communication
            between your order and the kitchen, API is a critical link between the client and server.</p>

        <h2>How does an API work?</h2>
        <p>An API can be described as a “gateway” to a server. A client (for example, your web browser or phone) wants
            to access information stored on a given server on the cloud. Therefore, the client often schedules a request
            to the API of the given server.</p>


        <p> On the server, there is probably some logic implemented that is responsible for providing the right
            resources requested by the client. Once the correct resources are collected, they are returned to the
            client.</p>

        <h2>What is the advantage of an API?</h2>
        <p>The main advantage of API is that whenever a software Developer writes code then he/she do not require to
            start writing the program from scratch and the developer can take the help of the APIs to proceed with their
            development.</p>
