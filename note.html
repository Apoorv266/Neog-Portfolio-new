        <h2>A little bit about my background :-</h2>
        <p>So I am Apoorv Sharma. I am basically from Uttarakhand but live in Bangalore as I have completed my studies in Bangalore in Bsc Biotechnology, zoology, and chemistry. </p>

        <h2>My coding Journey so far :-</h2>
        <p>In my 3rd year of college, while surfing the internet I saw a very visually appealing website and always felt that the person who must have made this website have such a cool job.</p>
        <p>That was the day when I got to know about "frontend development" and I decided that I have to master this. I instantly got a very strong feeling that this is what I want to do and there I was purchasing a brand new copy and putting the very first heading "WHAT IS HTML?".Fast forwarding to today,  I have basic to intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, javascript, react, and react toolkit, and always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge.</p>

        <p>Though my coding journey is not very smooth as I was all by myself, from searching roadmaps, gathering notes, following the correct technologies, clearing my own doubts through countless google searches, and dealing with frustrating bugs, everything I have managed on my own. There have been times when I almost gave up on coding but in the end this random quote that I found on social media kept me going:-</p>
        
        <p class="code"><b>DO NOT GIVE UP ON SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T GO A DAY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT !</b></p>

        <h2>Why I want to be in NeoG camp</h2>
        <p>My only motive to learn frontend/full stack development is to gain maximum knowledge to master this field. The quickest way to grow the knowledge exponentially is to learn from industry experts. </p>
        <p>I always like to challenge myself and I heard a lot from Tanay Sir during his level zero videos that levelOne is even tougher. This actually made me excited about it and i desperately want to learn it at any cost.</p>
        <p>I started level zero on 25th November 2022 and finally completed it on 5th December 2022. This level zero journey taught me so much and I am very excited to learn what's behind levelOne.</p>
        <p>I have a never give up attitude and a curious mindset that always searches for answers to expand my knowledge. Being a neoG level one student will raise my confidence to up to multiple folds and I am ready to give my 100% hard work and efforts to NeoG camp if I get selected.</p>
